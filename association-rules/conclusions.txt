In one of the experiments rules aiming to find associations between year-based ratings of unique users were searched. Every combination of year and simplified rating value (very bad/bad/mediocre/good/very good) was created and for each distinct user occurances of year-rating combinations were binarized (1902|very bad:0/1, 1902|bad:0/1 etc.). Resulting rules formed associations of the following arrangement: (1994|good, 1993|good) -> (1995|good). This approach did not produce very informative results and the experiment was generalized to include year intervals (e.g. (1995,2000]) and a narrower rating scale (bad/mediocre/good). Despite the changes, finding informative rules was difficult some of the conclusions seemed to not exclude their counterpart.
