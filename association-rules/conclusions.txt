In one of the experiments rules aiming to find associations between year-based ratings of unique users were searched. 
Every combination of year and simplified rating value (very bad/bad/mediocre/good/very good) was created and for each 
distinct user occurances of year-rating combinations were binarized (1902|very bad:0/1, 1902|bad:0/1 etc.). 
Resulting rules formed associations of the following arrangement: (1994|good, 1993|good) -> (1995|good). 
This approach did not produce very informative results and the experiment was generalized to include year intervals (e.g. (1995,2000]) and a narrower rating scale (bad/mediocre/good). 
Despite the changes, finding informative rules was difficult. 
Many of the rules seemed to not exclude existence of other rules that would imply a different conclusion.
This might be due to the fact that counting at least a single occurance of a rating in a year interval is not representative of the likelihood of
different ratings appearing together as the information about the frequency of ratings is lost due to the chosen grouping.
