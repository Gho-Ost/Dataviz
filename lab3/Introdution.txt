  The following analysis is based on a publicly available Rebrickable database containing information about lego parts, colors, types of parts,
as well as sets and themes, containing the year of production for each set, and much more. The goal of the analysis is to visualize and draw conclusions
when it comes to relations between the aforementioned attributes with a special emphasis on the time data analysis as a means
of understanding how the previous changes and trends when it comes to the relationship between available attributes,
influenced future company decisions and as such may at some point allow drawing further conclusions in the future. 
Lastly, emphasis has also been placed on analyzing unique and rare Lego parts to understand
what themes may be particularly likely and in effect what the collectors should set their sights on.
